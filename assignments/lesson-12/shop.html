            <h2>$8,299</h2>
            <img src="images/expensive.PNG" alt="Expensive Bicycle">

            <p>This particular build enjoys the crisp shifting and ultra-light efficiency of Shimano's XTR 11-speed
                drivetrain with a Race Face Next SL crankset for lightweight stiffness. This 11-speed drivetrain
                features a massive 11 to 46-tooth cassette for plentiful low-end when you're spinning up steep climbs
                and pedaling across long stretches of trail with undulating terrain. The FOX 36 Factory fork is
                impressively stiff, lending precise tracking for picking apart rough sections of trail and plunging into
                steep descents. It's finished with the Reynolds Carbon 36-millimeter wheels for snappy acceleration and
                precise tracking through the rough stuff, rolling on 2.6-inch Maxxis Wide Trail tires for impressive
                traction and cornering confidence. Another thing to note, the Industry Nine hubs feature an incredible
                3-degree engagement, meaning you'll get up and over trail impediments with their near-instantaneous
                response.</p>
